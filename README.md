# swissborg-test

- I haven't used Rx for a couple of years now and only used ViewModels briefly, so my implementation might not be the best there.
- I didn't invest any time in UI
- I didn't do any specific DI approach as it's a hot topic :) I created FakeDi that was sufficient for this app
- Only added simple unit tests for one class. Hope it's enough. Obviously most classes in `core` module should be tested.
